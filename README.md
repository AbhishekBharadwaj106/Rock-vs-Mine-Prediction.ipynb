Rock Vs mine Predictor

**Project Overview**
I have Builded this project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify objects as either rock or mine based on their characteristics. The dataset used in this project is sourced from sonar signals, which are reflected waves emitted to detect underwater objects. The goal is to accurately predict whether the detected object is a rock or a mine using advanced data preprocessing and classification techniques.

Features

Dataset: The project uses a labeled sonar dataset with features representing signal properties.
Preprocessing: Handling missing or inconsistent data.
Feature scaling and normalization.
Model Development:
Classification using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation:
Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
Confusion matrix for visualizing classification performance.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data manipulation and model development.
Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
Project Workflow
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset and visualize key features.
Preprocessing: Prepare the data by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it.
Model Building: Train and test multiple machine learning models.
Evaluation: Compare model performance and select the best classifier.
Deployment (optional): Save the trained model for future predictions.
